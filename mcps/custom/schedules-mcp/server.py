"""Schedules MCP Server.

stdio MCP server for scheduled, one-time, and trigger-fired background tasks,
plus scheduled self-continuations of the calling session. Communicates with
the proxy's Task Management REST API. Delegation (parallel worker sessions)
lives in the separate delegation-mcp.

Environment variables (set in per-agent mcp-config.json):
  SCHEDULES_MCP_AGENT      - Which agent this instance serves (e.g. "system-admin")
  PROXY_URL                - Proxy URL (e.g. "http://localhost:8400")
  SCHEDULES_MCP_API_KEY    - Proxy API key (falls back to PROXY_API_KEY from process env)

Cross-agent reads: the read tools take an optional ``agent`` arg — a slug,
or "all" for every agent the session's user can access. Server-side the
proxy filters by the TOKEN identity (reads follow the user), so this server
just forwards the arg: "all" maps to omitting the ``agent`` query param.
No-user sessions reach only their own agent plus their wired delegation
targets (agent-scope rows, read-only) — also proxy-enforced.
