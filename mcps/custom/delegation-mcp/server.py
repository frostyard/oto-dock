"""Delegation MCP Server.

stdio MCP server for visible parallel delegation: spawn worker sessions
(background tasks or first-class chats), monitor sibling sessions, peek
into delegated lanes, and send file copies to a target's inbox
(send_files — the passive half of cross-agent handoff). Scheduling
(recurring/one-time/trigger tasks) lives in the separate schedules-mcp.

Environment variables (set in per-agent mcp-config.json):
  DELEGATION_MCP_AGENT    - Which agent this instance serves (e.g. "system-admin")
  PROXY_URL               - Proxy URL (e.g. "http://localhost:8400")
  DELEGATION_MCP_API_KEY  - Proxy API key (falls back to PROXY_API_KEY from process env)
  DELEGATION_MCP_TARGETS  - Comma-separated cross-agent delegation roster
