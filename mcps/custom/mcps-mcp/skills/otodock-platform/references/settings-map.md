# Settings map — every page and tab, with the role it needs

Roles: *(any)* = any signed-in user · *(manager)* = per-agent manager (platform admin
implied) · *(editor+)* = per-agent editor or above · *(creator)* = platform creator ·
*(admin)* = platform admin. The UI hides what a role can't use — when a user "doesn't
have" a tab, check the role first, then whether the feature is enabled on the install.

## Top-level navigation

- **Agent pill** (top bar) → the **Agents page** *(any)*: Map / Grid / Departments
  views; **Create Agent** and **Browse Community** *(admin/creator)*; Departments tab
  *(admin/creator)*.

  vary)* · Admin *(admin)* · Logout.
