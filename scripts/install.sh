#
# What it does (each step announces itself before it runs):
#   1. Checks that Docker and the Compose plugin are installed and reachable.
#   2. Installs into the directory it is run from (give it a folder of its
#      own) — and refuses to touch a directory that already holds an install.
#      $OTODOCK_DIR is still honored as an override for older one-liners.
#   3. Writes a minimal .env with a generated PostgreSQL password (kept as-is
#      if one already exists; the server appends its own generated secrets to
#      the same file on first boot).
#   4. Ubuntu 24.04+ only: installs the scoped `otodock_userns` AppArmor
#      profile the agent sandbox needs on such hosts. May ask for your sudo
#      password; the system-wide hardening stays enabled. Other hosts skip
#      it entirely.
#   5. Linux only: applies the recommended vm.swappiness=10 host tuning via
#      /etc/sysctl.d/ (sudo again; declining it is safe — the install
#      continues either way).
#   6. Downloads the release-pinned docker-compose.yml, starts the stack, and
#      prints the dashboard URL.
#
# Fresh installs only — it never upgrades or overwrites an existing install
# (upgrades: https://docs.otodock.io/administration/upgrading). Safe to re-run
# if a step stopped it: everything that already exists is kept. All files land
# in the current directory; nothing else on the host is touched (except the
# optional AppArmor profile in step 4 and the optional sysctl drop-in in
# step 5, each documented in its own short script).
