"""Configuration + cross-platform helpers for the satellite daemon.

Loads ``satellite.conf`` (INI format) from:
  * ``~/.oto-dock/satellite.conf`` on Linux/macOS
  * ``~/OtoDock/satellite.conf`` on Windows

Cross-platform helpers used across the package:
  * ``OTODOCK_DIRNAME`` / ``otodock_dir()`` — install root location
  * ``venv_bin()`` / ``venv_exe()`` — Windows ``Scripts`` vs Unix ``bin``
  * ``kill_process_tree()`` — psutil-backed tree termination (kills
    ``cmd.exe`` → ``node.exe`` grandchildren on Windows)
  * ``atomic_replace()`` — ``os.replace`` with AV-retry on Windows
  * ``force_rmtree()`` — ``shutil.rmtree`` with AV-retry + cmd-rmdir
    fallback on Windows
  * ``relaunch_self()`` — per-user service-manager respawn after a
    clean exit (no-op on Linux; kickstart/schtasks on macOS/Windows)
  * ``hook_command()`` — settings.json hook-command string with
    quoted Python path for both platforms
  * ``WINDOWS_DETACHED_FLAGS`` — ``subprocess`` creationflags for
    detaching children from the satellite's process group
