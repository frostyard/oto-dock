    """Create the LLM backend for a phone route.

    Both proxy and direct modes go through ProxyClient. The proxy
    handles MCP tools, message history, and Anthropic API calls.

    ``phone_route_id`` is sourced from ``route.id`` directly so callers
    don't have to plumb it separately. Works for both inbound and outbound.

    Establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to the proxy for
    low-overhead communication across the entire call duration.
    Falls back to HTTP SSE if WebSocket connection fails.

    The caller-metadata kwargs (``audiosocket_uuid``, ``caller_phone``,
    ``caller_did``, ``dial_event``) are forwarded into the proxy's warmup
    message so it can resolve the route → trigger linkage and build a
    ``${trigger.*}`` payload enriching manifest ``agent_context`` blocks.
    Empty defaults mean "no enrichment" — the call proceeds with the base
    prompt. ``pin_verified`` is the PIN gate's result (inbound routes with a
    PIN) — it rides the warmup so the proxy can trust the caller's identity.
