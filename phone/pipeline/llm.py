        This is the turn state-machine — a ``while True`` loop where each
        iteration handles one turn. The phases, in order:

          1. SETUP — warmup wait, transcript tracking, select TTS voice, start
             the thinking filler + a fresh TTS streaming context.
          2. RESPONSE — either replay a pre-collected response (the parallel-LLM
             fast path, ``pending_response``) OR stream the LLM token-by-token
             into TTS, flushing on sentence/tool boundaries while protecting the
             [CALL_COMPLETE] / [QUESTION:] markers from being split mid-flush.
          3. COMPLETION — on [CALL_COMPLETE], wait for TTS to drain then hang up
             (inbound barge-in during the farewell resumes the call instead).
          4. QUEUED SPEECH — if the user spoke during playback, classify it as a
             continuation (re-batch into one turn) or a new query (run the next
             LLM in parallel with the current TTS, playing pre-tool filler in
             between for latency).
          5. LOOP OR EXIT — re-enter with the next transcript, or break.

        It is one long stateful method (rather than a request/response) because
        the full-duplex concerns above — barge-in cancellation, trailing-voice
        cooldown, queued speech, and parallel LLM — are driven by ``continue`` /
        ``break`` / ``return`` woven through the loop. Shared mutable state lives
        on ``self.state`` (CallState). For outbound calls it also records
        transcript entries and drives the [QUESTION:] hold/answer cycle.
