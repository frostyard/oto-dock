"""Mid-turn pump attach races.

Switching into a chat whose turn is ending raced the pump teardown ("the
story ended mid-sentence until I refreshed"). These tests lock the
pump-level invariants the fixes rely on:

- attach() is FAN-OUT: a second viewer (another device/tab, a teammate on a
  shared chat) gets its own queue and every frame — it never displaces the
  first viewer (the old single-slot steal made concurrent viewers' 3s
  _task_pump_poll fight over the stream, wholesale-reloading the chat every
  few seconds mid-generation).
- detach() removes only the CALLER's queue: a stale holder's close path can
  never stop another viewer's frames.
- DONE (turn boundary) KEEPS live_blocks accumulating: a consumer attaching
  between the turn's final save and the producer's exit still reconstructs
  the whole turn from live_state.
- DONE advances _db_msg_cutoff_id past the just-saved rows, so a resume's
  id-based truncation (keep messages with id <= cutoff_id) cannot hide a
  persisted turn.

The connection-level halves (promised-pump history re-send in
_enter_pump_loop; pump_ended always sending `done`) live inside the nested
ws_dashboard_handler closure — covered by live verification, not unit tests.
