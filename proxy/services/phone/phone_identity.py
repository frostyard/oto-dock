"""Who the caller IS on a phone route — the warmup-time identity resolver.

A phone route carries ``identity_mode`` (``caller`` / ``shared`` / ``user``)
and ``remember_callers`` (``storage/phone_route_store.py``). This module
turns one call's facts (the route, the agent the daemon asked for, the
caller-id the trunk reported, the daemon's PIN-gate result) into a
:class:`RouteIdentity` the config builder consumes. It is the ONLY place that
decides between an EXTERNAL principal (``core/session/external_identity.py``)
and a session tied to a platform user, and it binds the route to the agent:
a daemon that names a route of another agent gets nothing from it.

An external principal always runs with the **viewer** role
(:data:`EXTERNAL_ROUTE_ROLE`): it reads the agent's shared space and writes
only its own tree. The ``phone_routes.role`` column is a leftover of the
per-route role selector (removed 2026-09-08) and is ignored here.

Every fallback is loud (WARNING / ERROR) and lands on the safest identity —
the per-caller external principal — never on a user's session.
