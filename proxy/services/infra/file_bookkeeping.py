"""Platform-side bookkeeping for a file write / delete — the invariants every
writer path shares (the dashboard file API, the Direct-LLM builtin file
tools, recover-bin restore, knowledge-library rename projection):

- WRITE (``push_file_write`` / ``push_tree_write``): retire any delete
  tombstone (the path is live again), record the author for cross-user
  conflict attribution, fire the knowledge-library projection, then push the
  bytes to active remote sessions through the isolation-aware fan-out.
- DELETE (``delete_platform_file``): capture the bytes in the Recover bin
  (under the size cap), unlink, write the tombstone + clear the author (so an
  idle satellite APPLIES the delete instead of resurrecting the file), fan
  the delete out.

Moved out of ``api/agents/files.py`` (Plan B, 2026-09) so the Direct-LLM
builtins run the identical sequence instead of a second copy. Every caller
goes through THIS module (no private re-exports), so one monkeypatch point
covers them all.
