"""Live satellite connection status — merges in-memory WS state with DB.

The DB's `remote_machines.status` column is updated on lifecycle events
(connect, disconnect, heartbeat monitor tick) but can lag reality between
ticks. The authoritative source is `SatelliteConnectionManager._connections`
plus `last_heartbeat` timestamp. This module provides helpers that merge
both so API responses reflect the current state.

State categories:
- `online` — in-memory connection present, heartbeat < 60s ago
- `stale`  — in-memory connection present, heartbeat 60-90s ago (likely dying)
- `paused` — not connected AND the deliberate-pause flag is set (tray Pause).
  Offline by intent; a friendlier label than `disconnected`. Not reachable.
- `disconnected` — not in in-memory _connections and has last_seen in DB
- `never_connected` — no row or no last_seen (machine paired but never online)

    Reads from the in-memory `SatelliteConnectionManager._connections` map
    first (source of truth for active WS); falls back to DB `last_seen` for
    machines not currently connected.

    ``machine`` lets a caller that already holds the row (the 30 s admin
    alert evaluator walks every machine) skip the DB read. For a CONNECTED
    machine there is no DB read at all — ``last_seen_iso`` comes from the
    connection's in-memory last contact, which is at least as fresh as the
    coalesced DB copy. Loop-side callers must never trigger a read here for
    a connected machine (see storage/pg.py's event-loop rule).
