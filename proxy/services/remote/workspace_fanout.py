"""Active-session workspace fan-out — propagate a workspace write/delete to the
OTHER satellites currently running the same collaborative agent.

Background
----------
When users A and B run sessions for the same agent on DIFFERENT satellites, an
edit on A's machine only reached B's machine at B's next session start
(``core/remote/remote_execution.py::_initial_workspace_sync``). This module closes that
gap: every authorized platform-side workspace write — the per-turn ``file_changed``
applier (``core/remote/satellite_connection.py``), dashboard file-API edits + uploads,
Collabora saves (``api/media/wopi.py``) and file-tools writes (``push_back`` +
``hook_file_written``) — fans the new bytes out to every OTHER active session's
machine within the turn. ``propagate_write`` (below) is the shared "publish bytes
to the agent tree + fan out, atomically under the global lock" entry point for the
write paths whose bytes are produced OUTSIDE the ``file_changed`` applier.

Isolation
---------
Per-user / per-role isolation is enforced per target session via
``core/remote/file_sync.py::should_sync_to_target`` — the SAME push-direction predicate
``compute_manifest`` applies at session start. A user-paired (or agent-scope)
session only receives ``users/{own}`` + shared paths, never another user's data;
a non-owner session never receives ``config/``. This is exactly what makes routing
the dashboard / upload push helpers through the fan-out **fix** the historical
leak where they pushed to every machine of the agent unconditionally.

Source exclusion
----------------
``exclude_machine_id`` skips the originating satellite (it already has the bytes).
Pass ``None`` for platform-origin writes (dashboard / upload) — they have no source
machine, so the file goes to every *allowed* active machine.

Local sessions are a no-op — their workspace is a bwrap bind-mount of the platform
dir (same inode), so there is nothing to push and they never appear in the remote
layer's session registry.

Downstream of the write-back guard
-----------------------------------
The per-turn caller (``satellite_connection._apply_file_changed``) only invokes the
fan-out AFTER ``can_write_back`` authorizes the write — so the fan-out only ever
sees already-authorized paths and never has to re-filter ``.claude`` / ``.codex``
machinery. The push helpers (dashboard / upload) are likewise gated upstream by the
file-API role checks.

All functions are best-effort: a push failure to one machine is logged and never
raises (the file reconciles at that machine's next session start).

    every OTHER satellite running ``agent_slug`` — all under the global
    per-(agent, rel_path) lock so it never interleaves with the ``file_changed``
    applier / ``push_back`` / ``pull_through``.

    The shared propagation entry point for platform-side writes whose bytes are
    produced OUTSIDE the ``file_changed`` applier (so the proxy gets the final
    bytes directly, not a pull from a satellite):
      * **Collabora save** — ``api/media/wopi.py::wopi_put_file`` (Collabora already
        live-merged concurrent human editors → ``content`` IS the merged result);
      * **file-tools on a LOCAL session** — ``api/hooks/hooks.py::hook_file_written``
        local branch (the Docker MCP wrote the platform agent dir directly; we
        re-publish those bytes atomically + fan them out to remote satellites).

    Deliberately NO conflict-detect / recover-bin: by the time these callers run,
    the pre-overwrite bytes are already gone (there is no proxy-side pre-write
    hook), so loser attribution is unrecoverable. Last-writer-wins still converges
    because the global lock serializes this against every other platform writer.
    Conflict detection + recovery stays on the ``file_changed`` path
    (``core/remote/satellite_connection.py``) — the only writer that pre-captures.

    Failure semantics: the atomic disk write RAISES on failure (the caller treats
    it as fatal — e.g. Collabora's PutFile → 500). The fan-out is best-effort
    (``fan_out_write`` swallows per-push failures), so a satellite being offline
    never fails the write; it reconciles at that satellite's next session start.

    NOTE: ``push_back`` does NOT call this — it already holds the global lock for
    its own-machine push, so it calls ``fan_out_write`` directly (re-acquiring the
    same non-reentrant lock here would deadlock).
