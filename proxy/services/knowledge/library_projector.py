"""Shared-knowledge-library projector — keeps consumer mirrors true.

A promoted library — a subtree (``subdir``, '' = whole folder) of the
source agent's ``knowledge/`` — is mirrored into every attached consumer
at ``agents/<consumer>/knowledge/shared/<source>/<subdir>/``: the mirror
path is the SOURCE-ROOT-RELATIVE path under the slug segment, so
mirror→source mapping is identity (strip ``shared/<slug>/``) and the
whole-folder share keeps the exact pre-subdir layout. Mirrors are REAL
files on the platform host — that is what makes every non-sandbox
surface (dashboard tree, prompt workspace tree, satellite manifests and
fan-out) work without special cases. This module is the only writer of
mirror content and the only mirror→source bridge.

Merge base (2026-09-03): every converged (consumer, file) pair is
remembered in ``library_mirror_state`` (``storage/db_library_mirror_state``)
— the content hash + size/mtime the mirror and the source last agreed on,
the ``sync_state`` idea applied to libraries. It is what turns a bare
"the mirror lacks this file" into one of three things:

- no base row → the mirror never had it → project it (first sync);
- base row and the source still equals the base → the consumer DELETED it
  → for a WRITABLE attachment that is a deliberate delete: the source copy
  is captured to the recover-bin ("deleted"), removed at the source and
  from every other mirror; read-only attachments heal as before;
- base row but the source moved on since → the source wins, the mirror is
  healed (a stale delete never beats a newer edit).

And the mirror-holds/source-lacks case, which used to re-adopt a file into
the source from any writable mirror (undoing a source-side delete the
moment another consumer still held a copy), now reads the base too: a
base row means the SOURCE deleted it → the mirror copy is removed (kept in
the recover-bin only if it diverged from the base); no base row means a
genuinely new mirror file → adopted (RW) or captured+removed (RO).

Guards (the satellite delete-attribution incident class stays closed):
- MASS-DELETE GUARD — one reconcile pass never propagates more deletes
  from one consumer's mirror than ``max(MASS_DELETE_MIN,
  MASS_DELETE_FRACTION × tracked files)`` of that library: a wiped or
  restored consumer directory heals like before (WARNING logged).
- a deliberate delete requires HASH equality between the source and the
  base (never the quick-check alone);
- teardown drops the consumer's base rows before touching files;
- an absent/stale base row degrades to first-projection behaviour (heal),
  never to a delete.

Direction rules otherwise unchanged:
- source → mirrors: always, including deletions (the source is truth).
- mirror → source: only for WRITABLE attachments — creates/modifies
  discovered by comparison, EXPLICIT deletes through
  :func:`propagate_mirror_delete` (dashboard file API, satellite live
  deletes on RW mirrors), and reconcile-detected deliberate deletes above.
- read-only attachments: a locally edited mirror file (newer mtime,
  different bytes) is captured to the consumer's recover-bin
  ("conflict") and healed from the source.
- mirror content OUTSIDE every attached library subtree (possible only
  via direct-bind sandbox writes that bypass the hook) is captured the
  same way and removed — the projector owns the mirror namespace.

Freshness: mirrors carry the source file's mtime (``os.utime`` after
every projection); an equal size AND equal mtime pair is treated as
identical without re-hashing (rsync quick-check — the base row records
the hash for later attribution). When both sides changed, the newer mtime
wins — knowledge folders are git-versioned at both ends, which is the
deep-history safety net, so the projector does not attempt three-way
content merges.

Timing: the 5-minute sweep (:func:`reconcile_loop`) is the backstop;
:func:`schedule_reconcile_for_agent` is kicked at every chat/task turn
end so an agent's own sandbox delete or write lands before it reports.

Exclusions (never projected, in either direction) are keyed on the
SOURCE-ROOT-RELATIVE path: top-level ``memory/`` (agent memory) and
``shared/`` itself (no transitive nesting) — a subdir library's internal
folder that happens to be named ``memory`` is legitimate content;
``.git`` and ``.credentials`` at ANY depth (segment rule, matching
file_sync's ``.credentials`` push rule — a git clone inside a knowledge
folder must never fan its object store out to consumers); plus
``.partial`` temporaries.
