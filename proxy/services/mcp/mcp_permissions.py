"""Per-MCP-tool permission tiers — manifest declaration → mode decision.

A manifest's optional ``permissions`` block assigns each tool one of four
tiers (weakest gate first): ``open`` never prompts in any mode (including
plan), ``standard`` prompts only in ``default``, ``sensitive`` prompts in
``default`` AND ``acceptEdits``, ``critical`` always prompts — and is denied
outright in no-human contexts (``auto`` tasks/phone) rather than hanging.
Tools without a manifest declaration fall back to ``sensitive``, which is
byte-identical to the pre-tier MCP behavior (prompt in the prompting modes,
run silently in ``dontAsk``/``auto``).

Consulted from the ``mcp__`` branch of ``decide_tool_permission`` (all CLI
layers + the Codex approval bridge) and from the Direct-LLM inline gate.

Trust rail: a manifest that ships with the platform (``mcps/custom/``) may
declare any tier through any rule form. A catalog-installed manifest
(``mcps/community/``, ``mcps/skills/``) gets ``open`` honored ONLY from an
EXACT tool-name rule — a glob or ``default_tier`` resolving to ``open``
clamps to ``standard``. The catalog review process is the trust gate, and
requiring each silent tool to be named individually makes a T0 grant
impossible to hide in a wildcard and trivially auditable in a catalog PR
diff. The rail keys off the SCAN DIRECTORY (``manifest.mcp_dir``), never the
self-declared ``category`` field.
