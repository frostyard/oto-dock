    the chat belongs to a delegation project — the project-scoped one. Anchor
    authz = access to the chat (same rule as opening it); each pin row is then
    filtered by the app's OWN serve rule (``app_access``: personal rows →
    owner only), so a personal-scope project pin never leaks to other viewers
    — the documented v1 limit. Rows are shaped exactly like ``GET /v1/apps``
    (id/actions/sig/approval) so the overlay reuses AppFrame + the approval
    card unchanged. Soft-hidden pins are absent, like every viewer surface.

    ``files`` carries the Dock FILE pins (chat scope + project scope, in pin
    order) — just references: the overlay reads the content through the
    files API, where the viewer's own path-policy role decides what renders
    (a pin row itself leaks only the path + title)."""
