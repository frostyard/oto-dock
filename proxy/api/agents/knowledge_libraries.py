"""Shared knowledge libraries REST API.

Promote subtrees of an agent's ``knowledge/`` folder (``subdir = ''`` =
the whole folder) to installation-wide libraries and attach them
(read-only or writable) to other agents. Design + audit:
the shared-libraries design (v1) and its per-folder revision.

Wiring is platform-role territory (departments precedent): every mutation
gates on ``require_creator_interactive`` — dashboard admins/creators AND
real-user-backed session principals with those platform roles (the
operator-decided carve-out for the sensitive-tier agent-config-mcp
tools). Per-agent managers get the read endpoint for the config UI, and
never the mutations.

This module owns PROMOTE-TIME VALIDATION — the one funnel every library
mutation passes (dashboard + agent-config-mcp both call these routes):
subdir shape + existence + symlink containment, disjointness across the
agent's libraries, and the display name's filename-safety (the name
drives the library's bulletin filename, Windows/macOS satellites
included).
