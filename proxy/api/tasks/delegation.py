"""Delegation (Projects) API — worker spawn.

``POST /v1/delegation/spawn`` replaces the old MCP-side create→patch→run
dance with ONE atomic call: authorization (``services/delegation/spawn_authz``
— kill-switch, roster, scope clamp, identity, per-creator cap), worker-chat
creation for ``surface="chat"``, the dynamic-task row with its on-complete
callback registered BEFORE the fire, and the ``delegate_spawn`` badge event
on the delegating chat.
