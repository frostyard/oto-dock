"""Hook callback endpoints -- permission gate, image/url/file display, document
preview, tool results, permission responses, and the location bridge.

Path forms accepted by file-tools-style hooks (``/v1/hooks/file``,
``/v1/hooks/document-preview``, ``/v1/hooks/file-written``):

  * **Agents-relative** (canonical for Docker MCPs):
      ``personal-assistant/users/<user>/workspace/foo.docx``
  * **Sandbox-virtual** (canonical for stdio MCPs running with ``OTO_*`` env):
      ``/users/<user>/workspace/foo.docx``
  * **Satellite-absolute** (for remote sessions):
      ``{satellite_agents_dir}/personal-assistant/users/<user>/workspace/foo.docx``

Host-absolute paths (post-/agents/ mount) are NOT a valid form post-v2 — they
broke remote-satellite sessions where the host path doesn't exist on the
platform side. ``_classify_and_pull`` resolves whichever form arrives
(sandbox-virtual, satellite-absolute, or agent-relative).
