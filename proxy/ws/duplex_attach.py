"""Full-duplex chat voice — the chat-attach layer.

Runs the LLM half of a duplex session: daemon ``utterance`` frames become
turns on the bridge's chat session (any execution layer), the reply streams
back as ``text``/``tool_start``/``tool_end``/``done`` frames (the exact
``/ws/phone`` vocabulary — the daemon reuses its proven per-turn routing),
and ``abort_turn`` is the mid-generation barge-in.

Deliberate upgrades over the phone path (plan A4):

- **Pump guard, not clobber**: ``proxy/ws/phone.py`` registers its pump
  unconditionally — safe for phone-only chats, wrong for dashboard chats. A
  duplex utterance that finds a LIVE pump queues onto it
  (``pump.queue_message``) and streams that pump's tail instead; voice and
  typed turns serialize on the one-pump-per-chat invariant.
- **Graceful-first abort**: ``layer.abort()`` first (dashboard Stop
  ordering); only a hard abort also kills the pump. CLI/Codex keep the
  partial turn in engine history — real barge-in the raw producer-cancel
  never gave phone. The duplex path NEVER stamps ``last_turn_aborted`` (its
  own interruption prefix carries the fidelity; double-injection guard).
- **Layer-agnostic barge-in fidelity**: ``barge_in_chars`` rides
  ``send_message`` on every layer (direct-llm annotates its in-memory
  history; CLI/Codex ignore the kwarg) — non-direct layers additionally get
  a text note in the next utterance so the engine knows what was heard.
- **Producer drains**: the producer carries the dashboard shape's post-turn
  message/system/artifact drain loop, so a typed message queued mid-voice
  is delivered, never acknowledged-and-dropped.

The duplex context (``chat_duplex_context``) is injected as a
``<system-reminder>`` prefix on the FIRST duplex turn after each attach —
persisted session history carries it forward, so later turns need no repeat.
