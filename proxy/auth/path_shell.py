# Claude Code ships a DISTINCT ``PowerShell`` tool on Windows (and opt-in on
# Linux/macOS via CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL). Without dedicated handling it
# would hit the ``_ALLOW`` catch-all in check_tool_access → NO dangerous-deny, NO
# cross-user path check, NO credential / agent-config backstop — i.e. in
# dontAsk/auto (tasks + phone) fully-ungated PowerShell on a satellite the agent
# runs on as the operator's OS user. So PowerShell is routed through the SAME
# decision model as Bash (see _check_bash):
#   * _POWERSHELL_DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = the single hard-deny for non-admin
#     (catastrophic, never-legitimate forms only — bare-root recursive delete,
#     disk/volume format, raw drive write, HKLM nuke), re-scanned at every
#     encoded-command level;
#   * an unknown cmdlet → tier "ask" (prompt in default/acceptEdits, run in
#     dontAsk/auto) — never a hard-deny;
#   * Get-*/Select-*/… → "read" (auto-approve in default — kills the
#     prompt-on-every-command UX);
#   * destructive cmdlets (Remove-Item / Clear-Content / aliases) set
#     PathDecision.destructive → Pass-2 prompts even in acceptEdits;
#   * best-effort path extraction (-Path/-LiteralPath/positional + >/>>) routes
#     through the SAME cross-user path gate as Bash on shared-admin satellites
#     (path_policy_v2 normalizes Windows paths → the agent-config / OAuth / .ssh
#     denies apply to extracted args even when the raw-string backstops miss the
#     backslash form).
# PowerShell parsing is genuinely hard; the dangerous scan runs on the RAW string
# (robust to scriptblock/quote nesting via substring match — the safety floor),
# and anything unparseable falls to "ask" (the ASK-net).
