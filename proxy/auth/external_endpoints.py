"""Endpoint allowlist for EXTERNAL sessions (phone callers who are not
platform users) and the liveness rule for every phone-minted session token.

The counterpart of ``auth/service_endpoints.py`` for the other end of the
trust scale. A session on an external route carries a JWT like any agent
session — it sits in the CLI process env, and shell (where a role still has
one) can ``curl`` the proxy with it — so the tool-level rules alone would be
bypassable. The ``external_session_confinement`` middleware
(``middleware.py``) therefore:

  1. rejects (401) any session token carrying an ``ext`` claim whose session
     is no longer LIVE in a layer registry — a token lifted from a call is
     dead at hangup (this applies to user-tied phone sessions too);
  2. confines (403) tokens whose caller is not a platform user (``ext`` and
     no ``user_sub``) to the endpoints below — the memory op and the
     session-scoped callbacks the hook scripts and the attached MCPs use.
     Everything else — tasks, continuations, triggers, notifications,
     meetings, delegation, chats and transcripts, files, media, uploads,
     agent discovery, subscriptions, pins — is unreachable by construction.

Contributor contract — when do you add an entry here?
  - Only when a hook script or an MCP that is attached to EXTERNAL sessions
    (``mcp_registry.EXTERNAL_DENIED_MCPS`` and the ``"external"`` exclusion
    context decide that) calls a NEW proxy endpoint. Use an anchored
    ``^...$`` pattern scoped to the HTTP method(s) actually used, and ask
    whether an anonymous caller may drive that endpoint at all.
  - ``verify_session_match`` still binds the token's ``sid`` to the request
    body on the hook endpoints; this list only decides WHICH endpoints exist
    for an external caller.
