"""CodexAppServerSession — persistent ``codex app-server`` session management.

Codex runs as a long-lived JSON-RPC daemon (``codex app-server``, NDJSON over
stdio) — structurally identical to the Claude CLI's persistent subprocess.
A session spawns the daemon once, opens (or resumes) a thread, and runs each
turn via ``turn/start`` → stream notifications → ``turn/completed``, keeping the
daemon (and its warm MCP servers) alive across turns. Abort is ``turn/interrupt``
(daemon stays warm — no rollout-truncation hack).

Replaces the previous process-per-turn ``codex exec`` model. The pool API
(``create_codex_session`` / ``get_codex_session`` / ``close_codex_session`` /
``reap_idle_codex_sessions``) and the ``_codex_sessions`` registry are unchanged
so ``app.py`` / ``concurrency.py`` touchpoints keep working.

# not idleness, so grant ONE extra idle window (the same multiple the interactive
