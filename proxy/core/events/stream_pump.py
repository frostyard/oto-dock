"""ChatStreamPump — decoupled stream processor for dashboard chat turns.

Runs independently of WebSocket connections:
- Reads CommonEvent objects from producer via event queue
- Maintains live streaming state (_chat_streaming_state)
- Saves text and events to DB at turn boundaries
- Optionally forwards events to an attached WS subscriber

Execution-layer agnostic: consumes CommonEvent (not ClaudeStreamChunk).

Module-level state (_active_pumps, _pending_permissions,
_session_cumulative_cost) lives here and is imported by ws/dashboard.py.
