"""Ordered per-chat off-loop writer for chat rows.

The pump's turn-end persistence and the dashboard handlers' per-click writes
used to run their store calls ON the event loop, relying on loop atomicity
between ``await``s for their check-then-write sequences (there is no
per-chat lock anywhere). Moving them to the DB executor naively would break
two things: ORDER (a user row landing after the assistant blocks it
preceded; the next pump's cutoff read observing a stale table) and the
check-then-write atomicity. This module keeps both: every chat has ONE
FIFO lane of synchronous jobs, run one at a time on the dedicated DB
executor (``storage.pg.run_db``), never coalesced — chat rows are
append-only and every one must land. A job bundles the reads and writes
that must be atomic against other writers of the same chat (the
read-modify-write of ``total_cost``, the "set the title only when unset"
pattern, a compare-and-set run-status flip) and returns plain values the
loop-side code consumes.

Rules for callers:
  * A job captures PLAIN VALUES snapshotted on the loop (block lists, ids,
    deltas), never live pump/connection state, and touches nothing
    loop-bound (no notification broadcasts, no registries) — those run on
    the loop from the job's result.
  * Anything that must observe this chat's earlier writes (a history read
    after the pump's rows, the next pump's cutoff) is itself a lane job.
  * ``drain(chat_id)`` before publishing state that the DB must back
  (the pump drains before it leaves ``_active_pumps`` and broadcasts
  "ready"); ``drain_all`` at shutdown, before the executor stops.
