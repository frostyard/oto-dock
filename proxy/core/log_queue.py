"""Log records leave the event loop through a bounded queue; one thread
writes stderr and the rotating file.

Why: at the 2026-09-05 internal boot the loop thread stalled 8.9 s inside
``RotatingFileHandler.emit → stream.flush()`` while a deploy-time ``docker
prune`` hit the same disk — the same class as the 2026-09-03 outage
(synchronous Postgres commits on the loop), just a different writer. So
every handler that touches a file descriptor lives behind the queue: the
file, stderr (journald's stream socket and docker's log pipe both back onto
the disk), and uvicorn's own loggers (``app.py`` passes ``log_config=None``
so they propagate here instead of installing their own synchronous stream
handlers).

Drop, never block: a full queue means the writer is waiting on the disk, so
a blocking ``put`` would be the loop waiting on the disk one hop later, and
an unbounded queue turns a wedged disk into a memory leak (~12 MB/min at
the boot-storm rate of ~200 lines/s). Overflow drops the record and counts
it; the writer's first line after recovering reports how many went missing.
``QUEUE_SIZE`` covers ~50 s at that peak rate in ~10 MB.

``configure`` is a no-op when the target logger already has handlers —
``logging.basicConfig``'s contract, and what keeps the pytest capture
handlers (on the root by the time a test module imports ``app``) from being
joined by a writer thread and a ``proxy.log`` full of test noise.

Shutdown — three exits, each drained with a bound (a wedged writer must not
hold the exit hostage): uvicorn's ``Server.capture_signals`` re-raises the
SIGTERM/SIGINT it served after the graceful shutdown, so the process dies by
the signal and atexit never runs — ``exit_signal_handler`` (installed by
``app.py`` as the handler uvicorn restores) drains first, then lets the
default disposition end the process with the same status; the atexit hook
covers a plain interpreter exit; the exit failsafe in ``startup.py`` drains
with a shorter bound and skips ``logging.shutdown()`` when the drain fails —
the writer then holds the handler lock and a flush would block forever.
``SIGKILL`` / ``os._exit`` lose at most the queue contents.
