class SubagentRegistry:
    """Deterministic per-session subagent tracking, fed by BOTH layers.

    **Claude CLI:** emits, for every subagent (foreground OR background), a
    ``task_started`` event carrying a stable ``task_id`` plus the spawning
    ``tool_use_id``; when the subagent finishes it fires a ``SubagentStop``
    hook whose ``agent_id`` equals that ``task_id`` (idle-safe, out-of-band
    HTTP) and a ``task_notification`` on stdout (a backup that stalls while
    the ``-p`` process is idle). This registry binds the two so completion is
    KNOWN, not guessed. Only ``task_type == "local_agent"`` agents are tracked —
    backgrounded ``local_bash`` work emits ``task_started`` + ``task_notification``
    but NO ``SubagentStop``, so gating on it would hang the completion wait.
    Workflow-internal agents live only inside ``task_progress`` and never emit a
    top-level ``task_started``, so they can't pollute the gate either.

    **Codex:** the session's per-thread background-sub-agent supervisor calls
    ``register_spawn(agent_id, agent_id)`` at main-turn end for each still-active
    (background) sub-agent and ``mark_done(agent_id)`` when its thread reaches its
    terminal — keyed by the sub-agent's thread id (which is also the dashboard
    ``tool_use_id``). Foreground/waited Codex subs aren't registered here (they
    complete within the turn).

    Keyed internally by ``task_id`` (CLI ``agent_id`` / Codex thread id). The
    dashboard correlates by ``tool_use_id``.
