        *RW* = the user dir's ROOT is RO; its known subdirs (workspace/,
        context/, .claude/, .codex/, .credentials/) stack RW on top, so
        stray root-level files are kernel-denied for every tool path.

        †RO with `knowledge/.credentials/` stacked RW on top (when it
        exists): agent-scope MCP credentials live there and MCP processes
        write-check + self-refresh tokens in place. Tool access to the
        subtree stays blocked at the application layer (path_policy).

        `/config/` is **owner-only** — editor + viewer don't see it at all.
        Config shapes agent BEHAVIOR (prompt, MCP wiring, auto-loaded
        context). That's owner curation, not workspace collaboration.

        Kernel-level enforcement is the single source of truth for file
        access — sidesteps Codex's hook bypass for non-Bash tools. The
        application-level path_policy is defense-in-depth that runs in the
        Claude Code hook only — and the Direct-LLM file tools, which run
        inside the proxy with no bwrap underneath, resolve against this very
        list so they see exactly the kernel's view.

    ``external`` / ``external_home`` describe an EXTERNAL session (a phone
    caller who is not a platform user — see ``SandboxConfig``): the shared
    memory is masked and, with a home, the caller's own tree mounts at
    /caller.

    ``config_visible`` / ``mount_shared`` carry the visibility-modes decouple
    (``username`` here is the MOUNT username). Callers that resolve the agent's
    mode pass them explicitly; callers that don't get the historical behavior:
    ``config_visible`` derives from ``(owner-tier role AND a real mount user)``
    and ``mount_shared`` defaults True (every collaborative session has the
    shared dirs). This lets each of the four config builders adopt the explicit
    wiring independently without changing today's mounts.

    All three local layers (CLI / Codex / Direct-LLM) construct their sandbox
    through here, so the egress allow-set is resolved in this one place
    (isolation is mandatory). The caller may pass an explicit set (unit tests
    do); otherwise it's derived from the registry — the proxy hook port (always
    present) + T1 Docker-MCP loopback ports + T2 Docker-MCP container IPs + the
    enabled homelab MCP targets. ``user_sub`` resolves per-user targets (e.g.
    nextcloud). The proxy port is always present, so the set is never empty →
    the session is always wrapped; if resolution raises we fall back to the
    proxy port ONLY (a visible, degraded — but still isolated — session), never
    to host networking.

    ``mcp_config_path`` is the session's generated MCP config (JSON or TOML);
    the sandbox binds ONLY the MCP dirs referenced in it (see
    :func:`mcp_dir_binds_from_config`) — never the whole mcps/ tree.
    ``mcp_dir_binds`` overrides the derivation for layers with no config FILE
    (Direct-LLM's proxy-managed delivery passes its assigned stdio dirs).
