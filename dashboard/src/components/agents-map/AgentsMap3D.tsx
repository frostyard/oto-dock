/**
 * AgentsMap3D — the 3D company map, round 7: a TWO-LEVEL semantic-zoom map
 * inside a real environment.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT (round 11 — the NIGHT world, continuity cut): a real 3D
 * near-field under a photographic panorama, the same architecture games
 * use. The distant scenery is a generated ground-level NIGHT panorama —
 * starry sky, milky way band, moonlit pine treeline in the mid-distance
 * (mirror-wrapped equirect — mathematically seamless; rendered SHARP, no
 * background blur: blur read as "outside the world") — doubling as the
 * environment map. There is NO scene fog: the near-field blends into the
 * pano purely via the terrain's radial alpha fade plus color-matching the
 * moonlit meadow. Continuity is geometric too: the pano's bright meadow
 * band is authored ~5° BELOW the equirect midline — exactly where the
 * TERRAIN's far edge appears from typical camera poses — and the terrain
 * itself is large enough (760²) that its edge meets the treeline instead
 * of ending mid-view (round 10's small plane + toy-scale 3D conifers and
 * flat lake broke the illusion; all three are gone). The meadow is real
 * displaced geometry (flattened into clearings around every base)
 * carrying a night grass texture with TWO-SCALE anti-tiling (mirrored
 * repeat + low-frequency vertex-color mottling), color-matched to the
 * measured pano band; instanced crossed-quad GRASS TUFTS sway in a
 * vertex-shader wind (the FPS gate freezes the clock). Lighting is a
 * moonlit hemisphere + cool key bright enough that the ground reads as
 * ALIVE as the photo. Every department sits SUNK into the ground on a
 * premium SQUARE WALNUT slab — brass inlay + corner caps + beveled rim
 * highlight + warm bollard lamps on the corners — and the STAGED
 * department gets a real SpotLight from above: entering a department
 * turns its light on. The slabs are the department tap targets; no
 * colored card shadows anywhere (dept-color spill pools were cut —
 * they read as stains).
 *
 * The map OPENS directly on the favorite agent's department stage (operator
 * round 7) — overview is one zoom-out away.
 *
 * OVERVIEW: agents are compact GLASS PILLS ([chip][name][⋯] — the same
 * glass language as the stage, smaller); spaced-caps dept name + member
 * count floats high over each dais. Manual delegation shows as AGGREGATED
 * dais↔dais lines only.
 *
 * STAGE (tap a dais, or just keep zooming in — wheel/pinch IS the level
 * switch, Google-Maps style, no back buttons): the camera flies to a
 * composed Vision-Pro framing from INSIDE the ring looking outward; members
 * arrange into amphitheater arc rows per level — the HEAD row is FRONT and
 * closest (top role reads biggest; deeper ranks step away and higher) — as
 * ChartHop-flavored two-line cards (avatar + name / level). Row seat count
 * adapts to the screen (2 on phones, up to 8 on desktop) so cards never
 * leave the screen. Camera freedom is locked to rubber-banded parallax on
 * drag; a horizontal SWIPE dollies to the prev/next department around the
 * ring (Independents last), and a subtle bottom pager strip — a
 * center-locked scroller on phones — is the only lateral nav chrome.
 * Zooming out (wheel accumulate / pinch-in) returns to overview with
 * hysteresis.
 *
 * EDGES are DIRECTIONAL (the delegation model: each agent owns only its
 * OUTGOING targets): calm solid Line2 curves — a crisp amber core over a
 * faint white glow underlay — TRIMMED to stop at the panel edges, with a
 * small arrow tip + light halo sitting right at the target's edge (one
 * arrow = one-way, both ends = mutual). WebGL always renders under the
 * CSS3D card layer, so edges never crossing a card is load-bearing. The
 * map's "Link…" mode creates ONE direction (matching config semantics);
 * "Unlink" still severs both directions as a convenience.
 *
 * Camera discipline (the round-3 "pinned on one agent" bug): programmatic
 * overview tweens are cancelled the moment the user grabs the controls and
 * carry a convergence deadline; the favorite-department opening placement
 * is INSTANT, never a tween. On stage MapControls is disabled entirely and
 * the camera pose is owned by the stage state machine.
 *
 * Bloom: UnrealBloomPass behind a runtime quality gate — sustained slow
 * frames permanently drop the composer back to the plain renderer.
 *
 * WebGL discipline: renderer creation is guarded (failure reports up → the
 * page falls back to the grid, which is also why jsdom tests survive), and
 * unmount disposes the scene AND force-loses the context — browsers cap
 * live WebGL contexts and xterm already taught us leaked contexts kill
 * later pages.
